FAQ:

1. How do I override the default theme ?
    - Go to flow's data directory, check where it is in "About" dialog, it's (~/.local/share/KDAB/flow/) on Linux
    - Add a Style.qml file there, you can now override style properties.
    - The complete list of properties is at: https://github.com/iamsergio/flow-pomodoro/blob/master/src/qml/DefaultStyle.qml

    Example file:

        import QtQuick 2.0
        import "qrc:/qml/"

        DefaultStyle {
            slackingText: "You're slacking" // Override "flow" text
        }

    For mobile you'll want to inherit from MobileStyle instead of DefaultStyle.

2. How do I change the default title ("flow") to something else ?
   Use the example file from question 1.

3. Where does flow look for plugins ?
   It looks in /<prefix>/lib/flow-pomodoro/plugins/, $QT_PLUGIN_PATH/flow-pomodoro/ and <dir_containing_executable>/plugins/

4. Why doesn't pidgin plugin work ?
   You need to apply this patch: https://developer.pidgin.im/attachment/ticket/15824/patch.diff

5. How to use hardware acceleration on Windows ?
   Flow-pomodoro ships OpenGL32.dll from mesa project, which uses software rendering.
   If you think you have decent OpenGL graphic drivers simply delete the shipped OpenGL32.dll
   and flow will pick the system one. If you have nvidia or ATI chances are it will work.
   This question only applies if you downloaded the pre-built flow for windows.

6. How do I specify the screen coordinates where flow appears ?
   Go to settings, choose "Last Position" on the "Initial window position" combo
   Move the window to where you want.

   Under Windows you can't move frameless windows, but you can go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\KDAB\flow-pomodoro
   to edit windowLastPositionX and windowLastPositionY. Be sure to quit flow before editing.

7. How do I change flow's data directory ?
   By default it's ~/.local/share/KDAB/flow/ on Linux and C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\KDAB\flow\ on Windows.
   You can set FLOW_DIR environment variable and flow will store it's flow.dat file there.
